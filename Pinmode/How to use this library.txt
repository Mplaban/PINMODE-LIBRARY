LIBRARY: pinmode.h
WORKS FOR: Arduino IDE

There are two in-built functions:
1. void IN()
2. void OUT()

void IN(num, ...)

 This function declares all given pins as input pins.

 example :
  to declare pins 2, 3, 4 and 5 as input we write:
  IN(4, 2, 3, 4, 5);

 the first argument passed is the number of pins to be declared as input.

void OUT(num, ...)

 This function declares all given pins as output pins.

 example :
  to declare pins 2, 3, 4 and 5 as output we write:
  OUT(4, 2, 3, 4, 5);

 the first argument passed is the number of pins to be declared as output.
